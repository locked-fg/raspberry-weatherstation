Raspberry PI Config
========================

The raspberry pi configuration (for Raspbian Wheezy) that is applied to weatherstation RasPis described in [my blog posts](http://www.locked.de/2014/03/16/my-first-raspberrypi-project-tv-controlled-weatherstation/).

The code for the graphical interface can be [accessed here](https://github.com/locked-fg/Weatherstation).
